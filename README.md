# 📊 Project Title: Personal Information Identification (PII) Detection

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for **PII Detection** using machine learning techniques. It was developed as part of a Kaggle competition, where I participated and scored **0.81**. The notebook leverages advanced tools for efficient data processing, training, and inference with distributed strategies and mixed precision.

## ⚙️ Libraries Used:
- Python 3.10
- scikit-learn
- NLTK
- spaCy

## 🧠 Features:
- **Data Parallelism:** Efficient training using the `DataParallel` strategy for large datasets.
- **Mixed Precision:** Enables larger batch sizes and faster training times by utilizing mixed precision.
- **Reproducibility:** Set random seeds for consistent results across runs.

## 📁 Dataset:
This notebook works with a dataset containing sensitive information where we aim to identify and mask PII fields.
